Note that 
\begin{align*}
    a^2 + b^2 = (a + bi)(a - bi).
\end{align*}
Define $z = a + bi$. Then:
\begin{align*}
    & a^2 + b^2 \\
    &= (a + bi)(a - bi) \\
    &= z \cdot \overline{z}.
\end{align*}
Now, notice that:
\begin{align*}
    & (a^2 + b^2)^n  \\
    &= (z \cdot \overline{z})^n \\
    &= z^n \cdot \overline{z}^n \\
    &= z^n \cdot \overline{z^n}.
\end{align*}
Now, for some integer $c, d$, notice that $z^n = c + di$ by Binomial Theorem. \\~\\
So, we can let $(x, y) = (c, d)$ and we are done. \\~\\
Now, for the bonus, notice that the only potential problems occour in perfect square scenarios: so, either $n$ is even, or
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ for some $c$. However, we only deal with the first case, as it is well known that $c = \alpha^2 + \beta^2$ for integer $\alpha, \beta$
in the second case. \\~\\
We need $(a^2 + b^2)^{2n} = c^2 + d^2$, or show that $(a^2 + b^2)^n = \alpha^2 + \beta^2$ for non-zero $\alpha, \beta$ and $\alpha \ne \beta$ 
to avoid $d=0$. \\ 
Now we prove that if an $\alpha = \beta$ solution exists, we show that some other solution must also exist. Cut because I don't have 
time to write a proof. \\~\\
\textbf{Note:} There need to be more conditions on this bonus. $n = 8$, $a = 1$, $b = 1$ is a counterexample and I think this is true for all 
$n = 2k$ - I have not proved this yet, though, but I am certain for $k = 4$.
